The stripes and pairs jobs both took roughly 2 minutes each at 148 seconds and 128 seconds respectivly.
This was once I managed to get SSH and pooling working on Windows. 
This stopped lags for s3 log transfers and the start time for each machine.
I used a 4 node cluster. 
I let the system decide how these were used in terms of nubmer of mappers and reducers.
Pairs:
Launched map tasks=10
Launched reduce tasks=6

Stripes:

Launched map tasks=8
Launched reduce tasks=6
